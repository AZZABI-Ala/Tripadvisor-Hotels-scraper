# Tripadvisor-Hotels-scraper
Scraping script for TripAdvisor using BeautifulSoup 
This repo contains the script I used to extract web page data (tripadvisor hotels) using a python script that I wrote using BeautifulSoup.
The file 'Scraper_tripadvisor_french.ipynb' extracts comments (in french) on the HOTELS of a particular city from tripadvisor.
The file 'Scraper_tripadvisor_english.ipynb' extracts comments (in english) on the HOTELS of a particular city from tripadvisor.
